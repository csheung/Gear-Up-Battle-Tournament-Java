# Gear Up: Battle Tournament - A Java-Based Role Playing Game

Gear Up: Battle Tournament is a Java-based role-playing game that allows users to create their own characters and equip them with unique head gears, hand gears, and foot gears. The game's main feature is the tournament battle, where users can pit their characters against other players' characters.<br>

The game is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to ensure clean separation of concerns and easy maintainability. The Java Swing library is used to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes the game more interactive and engaging.<br>

One of the challenges of developing a game is handling runtime exceptions such as illegal arguments. That's why Gear Up: Battle Tournament applies the JUnit testing framework to handle exceptions during runtime. This ensures that the game runs smoothly without crashing and provides a better user experience.<br>

Gear Up: Battle Tournament is a fun and engaging game that allows users to showcase their strategic skills and compete with other players in a tournament-style battle. The game is open-source and available on GitHub for anyone to contribute and improve upon.<br>
